## Project overview

Multi-agent parliamentary debate framework. Three or more LLM providers debate a
question through three structured phases — First Reading, Debate, Division — and
produce a structured Hansard verdict with Consensus, Split, Risks, and
Recommendation sections.

**Entry points:**
- `parliament` — curses TUI
- `parliament ask` — one-shot CLI
- `parliament doctor` — health check

## Architecture

### Debate pipeline

```
Parliament.ask(question)
  └── first_reading.run_first_reading()   → list[Response]  (parallel)
  └── debate.run_debate()                 → list[Response]  (parallel)
  └── division.run_division()             → Synthesis
  └── returns Hansard
```

All three phases emit `ProgressEvent` objects via `on_progress` callback.
The renderer (`DebateRenderer`) receives these events and draws to screen.

### Abort vs degrade

The two parallel phases gather with `return_exceptions=True`, then every result
must be classified as *abort* or *degrade*. That decision lives in one place,
`procedures/results.py::partition_results()`, so First Reading and Debate cannot
drift apart.

- **`Exception` → degrade.** A provider fault (timeout, quota, connection
  refused) drops that member and the debate continues with the survivors. This
  is intended behaviour.
- **Any other `BaseException` → abort.** `CancelledError`, `KeyboardInterrupt`,
  `SystemExit`. These mean something upstream asked for the work to stop, so
  they are re-raised rather than absorbed. Swallowing them turns a Ctrl-C or an
  enclosing `asyncio.timeout` into a confident verdict built from fewer members
  than the user configured — which is the failure mode #9 (MCP server mode)
  makes dangerous, because an agent acts on that verdict.

Never reintroduce a bare `isinstance(r, Exception)` filter in a phase — it
misses `CancelledError`, which is a `BaseException`.

A Hansard built from fewer members than configured carries `degraded=True`.

### Threading model

- **Worker thread** runs the asyncio event loop with `Parliament.ask()`
- **Main thread** polls `done.wait(0.05)` and calls `renderer.redraw()` every tick
- PDCurses on Windows is **not thread-safe** — all curses drawing must happen on
  the main thread. `CursesLiveRenderer.emit()` only mutates state; `redraw()` draws.
- Rich (`cli_live.py`) uses its own `Live` region on a separate thread — that's fine
  because Rich manages its own locking.

### Hansard detail levels

`HansardLevel` in `render/hansard.py` is the single source of truth.
Four levels (`minimal` → `verdict` → `archive` → `full`), strictly monotonic.
Precedence for resolution: CLI flag > env var > config > default (`minimal` —
`HansardLevel.parse` falls back to it for `None` and unknown values).
Saved `.md` files are written at `archive` regardless of the display level
(`tui.py::_save_hansard`).

### Config precedence

All `resolve_*` helpers in `config.py` follow: CLI flag > env var > config YAML > default.

## Development conventions

### Contribution workflow

`CONTRIBUTING.md` is the human-facing entry point: setup, the dev loop, recipes,
and PR expectations. Both must stay true — if you change a convention here,
check whether `CONTRIBUTING.md` repeats it.

Every PR runs `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: `ruff check .` and
`mypy src/parliament` on Linux, and `python -m pytest -q` on Linux
(3.11/3.12/3.13), macOS, and Windows. Run all three locally before pushing.

Issues carry `good first issue` and `help wanted` labels; small, well-scoped
gaps should be filed as issues with those labels rather than fixed silently, so
that new contributors have somewhere to land.

### Commit identity

If you are an agent committing on someone's behalf, do not commit as yourself.
Before running `git commit`, make sure `git config user.name` / `user.email`
resolve to the human you're working for, not the agent's own default identity
(e.g. `claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`) — an unconfigured identity gets
attributed to whatever account GitHub matches that email to, not to the person
who actually did the work. Credit the assistant with a trailer instead of as
author:

```
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

### Testing

```bash
python -m pytest -q          # 433 tests expected (as of #34)
ruff check .                 # must be clean before any commit
mypy src/parliament          # must pass before any commit
```

Dev deps (`pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `ruff`, `mypy`) are in `pyproject.toml` under
`[project.optional-dependencies] dev`. Install via `pipx inject` or `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.

The mypy config is a permissive baseline to ratchet rather than a full type
gate: with only `ignore_missing_imports`, unannotated function bodies are not
checked at all. Treat a green run as “nothing already annotated regressed”.

### Code style

- Ruff enforces style — run before committing, fix all warnings
- No `print()` in library code; use `console.print()` (CLI) or curses draws (TUI)
- Module-level `console` in `cli.py` is a singleton — for real TTY it uses
  `Console(force_terminal=True, legacy_windows=False)`; for non-TTY (tests, pipes)
  plain `Console()` to avoid wrapping/colour artifacts
- All curses text output goes through `_add_line()` (tui.py) or
  `_safe_addstr()` (tui_live.py) — never call `addstr`/`addnstr` directly
- Use `_wrap_text(text, width)` in tui.py for any multi-line content block

### Adding a slash command

1. Write `def _mycommand(args: str, ctx: CommandContext) -> CommandResult` in `commands.py`
2. Add a `Command(...)` entry to the `COMMANDS` list at the bottom of the file
3. The TUI command palette and `/help` pick it up automatically

### Adding a provider

1. Subclass `Provider` in `providers/base.py`
2. Add the provider key to `KEY_PROVIDERS` in `config.py`
3. Wire it up in `config.py::build_parliament_from_config()`
4. Add model presets to `model_catalog.py`

### Synthesis parser

`division.py::parse_synthesis()` splits the Speaker's raw response into
`Synthesis` fields. The regex handles plain headers (`CONSENSUS:`),
markdown headers (`### CONSENSUS`), and bold variants (`**CONSENSUS**`).
If parsing fails the entire response falls back to `recommendation`.

## Key files to know before making changes

| Change area | Read first |
|-------------|-----------|
| CLI commands | `cli.py`, `config.py` |
| TUI screens | `tui.py` (all screens in one file) |
| Slash commands | `commands.py` |
| Debate phases | `procedures/` |
| Rendering | `render/hansard.py`, `render/cli_live.py`, `render/tui_live.py` |
| Settings persistence | `tui.py::_save_settings()`, `config.py::save_config()` |
| Test helpers | `tests/conftest.py`, `tests/test_curses_renderer.py::FakeStdscr` |

## Platform notes

### Windows

- Use Windows Terminal — `cmd.exe` garbles Unicode glyphs and Braille spinner dots
- `windows-curses` is a required dep on Windows; provides `_curses.cpXXX-win_amd64.pyd`
- `asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy` must be set before `asyncio.run()` on Windows
  (Python 3.14 emits a DeprecationWarning — expected, not a bug)
- `/update` uses `url2pathname()` to convert `file://` URLs from `direct_url.json`
  (urlparse leaves a leading `/` on Windows drive letters without it)

### Editable install (for /update to work)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/elarmuzik1993/llm-parliament.git C:\Code\llm-parliament
pipx install --force --editable C:\Code\llm-parliament
```

The `parliament` binary then points directly at the working tree — `git pull`
is enough to update without reinstalling.

## Config file locations

| Platform | Config | Keys | Hansards |
|----------|--------|------|---------|
| Linux/macOS | `~/.parliament/config.yaml` | OS keyring / `~/.parliament/keys.env` | `~/.parliament/hansards/` |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\.parliament\config.yaml` | OS keyring / `%USERPROFILE%\.parliament\keys.env` | `%USERPROFILE%\.parliament\hansards\` |

Config is outside the repo — never committed. Only `config.example.yaml` ships with the repo.

## Current release
