First Reading and Debate both fan out to one coroutine per member with
``asyncio.gather(..., return_exceptions=True)``, then have to decide what the
results mean. That decision lives here so the two phases cannot drift apart —
see #34, where the equivalent change was applied to one of the two
``isinstance`` checks in each file and not the other.
